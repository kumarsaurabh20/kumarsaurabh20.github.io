title: Bee Toxicogenomics 
summary: In this research (2014 - 2017) theme we aimed to understand the molecular basis of the intrinsic tolerance of bee pollinators to certain insecticides and the genes/proteins that determine sensitivity. An understanding of why certain insecticides are highly toxic to pest insects but not bees can be harnessed in the development of bee-safe insecticides.
