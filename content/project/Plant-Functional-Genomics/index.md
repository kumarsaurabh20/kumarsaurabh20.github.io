## Abstract
The mission of the Chair of Plant Functional Genomics is to understand the molecular basis of plant traits that are relevant to society. These traits can be related to resilience to climate change as well as crop quality aspects such as the presence of health components or nutritional value. Our philosophy is that understanding traits in breeding germplasm will help breeders select for better plants and define strategies to improve crops through the application of new breeding technologies. Our mission is to use our research to make a difference in breeding, to enhance the capabilities of the Plant Functional Genomics Chair, to bridge the gap between computational methods and plant biology, and make valuable contributions to the field of plant genomics.

## Objectives
1. Multi-omics-assisted breeding.
2. Multi-omics-assisted plant-trait specific pathway(s) exploration.
3. AI-assisted plant functional genomics.
