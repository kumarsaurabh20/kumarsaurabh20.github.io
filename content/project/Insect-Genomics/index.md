title: Insect Genomics
summary: This project (Nov 2014 - Mar 2021) was mainly driven by key questions in resistance evolution of insect-pests to natural and synthetic insecticides. I used genome-wide investigations and computational approaches to answer such questions, ensuring these are relevant to a broad scientific community.
