My research interests include exploring *-omics* data to understand patterns and mechanisms of plant biotic interactions and co-evolution. In collaboration with the WUR Bioinformatics group (Dr. Marnix Medema), Plant-Microbe interaction group (Prof. Saskia Van Wees/Prof. Corn√© Pieterse) at Utrecht university and Microbial ecology group at NIOO-KNAW (Prof. Jos Raaijmakers), I explore and implement innovative *-omics* integration strategies to map genes and their expression patterns to metabolites that play key roles in host-microbe interactions.
