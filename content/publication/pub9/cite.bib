    abstract = {Author summary Bees have evolved sophisticated metabolic systems to detoxify the natural toxins encountered in their environment. Recent work has shown that specific enzymes (cytochrome P450s) in these biotransformation pathways can be recruited to protect honey bees and bumblebees against certain synthetic insecticides, including some neonicotinoids. However, it is unclear if solitary bees that carry out important pollination services have equivalent enzymes that play a key role in defining their sensitivity to insecticides. In this study we show that the genome of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis, lacks the subfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes that break down certain neonicotinoids in eusocial bees. Despite this, O. bicornis exhibits marked tolerance to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid as a result of efficient metabolism by a P450 enzyme from an alternative subfamily. The discovery that O. bicornis has key detoxification enzymes that determine its sensitivity to neonicotinoids can be leveraged to safeguard the health of this important pollinator.},
