AB  - The Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, is a major pest of soybean in 
      South America. The importance of E. heros as a pest has grown significantly in 
      recent times due to increases in its abundance and range, and the evolution of 
      insecticide resistance. Recent work has begun to examine the genetic diversity, 
      population structure, and genetic mechanisms of insecticide resistance in E. 
      heros. However, to date, investigation of these topics has been hampered by a 
      lack of genomic resources for this species. Here we address this need by 
      assembling a high-quality draft genome for E. heros. We used a combination of 
      short and long read sequencing to assemble an E. heros genome of 1.4 Gb 
      comprising 906 contigs with a contig N50 of 3.5 MB. We leveraged this new genomic 
      resource, in combination with genotyping by sequencing, to explore genetic 
      diversity in populations of this species in Brazil and identify genetic loci in 
      the genome which are under selection. Our genome-wide analyses, confirm that 
      there are two populations of E. heros co-occurring in different geographical 
      regions in Brazil, and that, in certain regions of the country these populations 
      are hybridizing. We identify several regions of the genome as under selection, 
      including markers associated with putative insecticide resistance genes. Taken 
      together, the new genomic resources generated in this study will accelerate 
      research into fundamental aspects of stinkbug biology and applied aspects 
      relating to the sustainable control of a highly damaging crop pest.
