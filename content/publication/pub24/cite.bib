AB  - In some aphid species, intraspecific variation in body colour is caused by 
      differential carotenoid content: whilst green aphids contain only yellow 
      carotenoids (β-, γ-, and β,γ-carotenes), red aphids additionally possess red 
      carotenoids (torulene and 3,4-didehydrolycopene). Unusually, within animals who 
      typically obtain carotenoids from their diet, ancestral horizontal gene transfer 
      of carotenoid biosynthetic genes from fungi (followed by gene duplication), have 
      imbued aphids with the intrinsic gene repertoire necessary to biosynthesise 
      carotenoids. In the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum a lycopene (phytoene) 
      desaturase gene (Tor) underpins the red/green phenotype, with this locus present 
      in heterozygous form in red individuals but absent in green aphids, resulting in 
      them being unable to convert lycopene into the red compounds 
      3,4-didehydrolycopene and torulene. The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, 
      separated from the pea aphid for ≈45MY also exists as distinct colour variable 
      morphs, with both red and green individuals present. Here, we examined genomic 
      data for both red and green morphs of M. persicae and identified an enlarged 
      (compared to A. pisum) repertoire of 16 carotenoid biosynthetic genes (11 
      carotenoid desaturases and five carotenoid cyclase/synthase genes). From these, 
      we identify the homolog of A. pisum Tor (here called carotene desaturase 2 or 
      CDE-2) and show through 3D modelling that this homolog can accommodate the 
      torulene precursor lycopene and, through RNA knockdown feeding experiments, 
      demonstrate that disabling CDE-2 expression in red M. persicae clones results in 
      green-coloured offspring. Unlike in A. pisum, we show that functional CDE-2 is 
      present in the genomes of both red and green aphids. However, expression 
      differences between the two colour morphs (350-700 fold CDE-2 overexpression in 
      red clones), potentially driven by variants identified in upstream putative 
      regulatory elements, underpin this phenotype. Thus, whilst aphids have a common 
      origin of their carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, two aphid species separated for 
      over 40MY have evolved very different drivers of intraspecific colour variation.
