TI  - Effective data visualization strategies in untargeted metabolomics.
LID - 10.1039/d4np00039k [doi]
AB  - Covering: 2014 to 2023 for metabolomics, 2002 to 2023 for information 
      visualizationLC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics is a rapidly developing 
      research field spawning increasing numbers of computational metabolomics tools 
      assisting researchers with their complex data processing, analysis, and 
      interpretation tasks. In this article, we review the entire untargeted 
      metabolomics workflow from the perspective of information visualization, visual 
      analytics and visual data integration. Data visualization is a crucial step at 
      every stage of the metabolomics workflow, where it provides core components of 
      data inspection, evaluation, and sharing capabilities. However, due to the large 
      number of available data analysis tools and corresponding visualization 
      components, it is hard for both users and developers to get an overview of what 
      is already available and which tools are suitable for their analysis. In 
      addition, there is little cross-pollination between the fields of data 
      visualization and metabolomics, leaving visual tools to be designed in a 
      secondary and mostly ad hoc fashion. With this review, we aim to bridge the gap 
      between the fields of untargeted metabolomics and data visualization. First, we 
      introduce data visualization to the untargeted metabolomics field as a topic 
      worthy of its own dedicated research, and provide a primer on cutting-edge 
      visualization research into data visualization for both researchers as well as 
      developers active in metabolomics. We extend this primer with a discussion of 
      best practices for data visualization as they have emerged from data 
      visualization studies. Second, we provide a practical roadmap to the visual tool 
      landscape and its use within the untargeted metabolomics field. Here, for several 
      computational analysis stages within the untargeted metabolomics workflow, we 
      provide an overview of commonly used visual strategies with practical examples. 
      In this context, we will also outline promising areas for further research and 
      development. We end the review with a set of recommendations for developers and 
      users on how to make the best use of visualizations for more effective and 
      transparent communication of results.
