abstract: The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta, is an invasive crop pest that has evolved resistance to many of the insecticides used for its control. To facilitate the investigation of the underpinning mechanisms of resistance in this species we generated a contiguous genome assembly using long-read sequencing data. We leveraged this genomic resource to investigate the genetic basis of resistance to the diamide insecticide chlorantraniliprole in Spanish strains of T. absoluta that exhibit high levels of resistance to this insecticide. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that, in these strains, resistance is not associated with previously reported target-site mutations in the diamide target-site, the ryanodine receptor, but rather is associated with the marked overexpression (20- to >100-fold) of a gene encoding a UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT). Functional expression of this UGT, UGT34A23, via ectopic expression in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrated that it confers strong and significant resistance in vivo. The genomic resources generated in this study provide a powerful resource for further research on T. absoluta. Our findings on the mechanisms underpinning resistance to chlorantraniliprole will inform the development of sustainable management strategies for this important pest.
