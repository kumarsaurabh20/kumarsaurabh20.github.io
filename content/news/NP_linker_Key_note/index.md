title: (28-03-25) Delivered an invited key note talk at the NPLinker eScience Symposium March 2025 at Wageningen University  
summary: Thank you Dr. Justin J.J. van der Hooft and Prof. Dr. Marnix Medema for making me a part of such a dynamic workshop! It was a pleasure to share insights multiomics approaches for plant biosynthetic gene cluster discovery and presented MEANtools during the workshop. The symposium and the workshop were incredibly stimulating, and itâ€™s exciting to see how the community is pushing the boundaries of paired-omics analyses. Many congratulations once again for marking 10 years of the genome mining group and 5 years of the computational metabolomics group. Your group and your work are truly inspiring and I am fortunate to be a part of this community. Looking forward to staying connected and building future collaborations!
