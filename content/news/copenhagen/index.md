title: (14/11/22 - 17/11/22) Copenhagen Bioscience Conference on Plant-microbe Interactions
summary: I had a great time attending the Copenhagen Bioscience Conference on Plant-microbe Interactions for enhanced crop resilience. I truly had good discussions on my research and in general on all the topics covered in the conference. I also won a poster prize on my poster that I presented in the conference. Special thanks to all the organizers involved, all the presenters who presented their work and to Novo Nordisk Foundation for organizing such a great workshop.
