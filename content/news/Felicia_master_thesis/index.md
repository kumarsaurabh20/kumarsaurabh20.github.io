title: (25-04-22) Successful master thesis defense by Felicia Wolters at WUR 
summary: Felicia C. Wolters defended her master dissertation (Master of Science, Major Phytopathology and Entomology) on the topic "Evolution of the Hydroxygeranyllinalool Diterpene Glycoside Pathway in Solanaceae". This work was jointly supervised by Iris Kappers (Plant physiology, WUR), Marnix Medema (Bioinformatic group, WUR) and me.

## Abstract
Diversity of plant secondary metabolites evolved dynamically by a continuous arms-race of plant defense and herbivore counteradaptation. Hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides (HGL-DTGs) have been found to confer plant resistance against herbivorous insects in the Solanaceae family. Specific decorations of the HGL aglycone result in a diverse palette of HGL-DTGs. In Nicotiana attenuata, key enzymes involved in HGL-DTG biosynthesis have been characterized recently. In other species however, the genetic background underlying HGL- DTG biosynthesis is still understudied. In this thesis project, orthologues in ten Solanaceae species were phylogenetically analysed. A family-wide gene cluster search revealed clustering of glycosyltransferase candidates in Capsicum annuum. The diversity of constitutive HGL-DTG decorations was studied in C. annuum accessions by LC-MS/MS analysis. Specific HGL glycosylation occurred in a resistant accession. Herbivore induced HGL- DTG related gene expression was investigated in resistant and susceptible genotypes of C. annuum upon induction by Jasmonic acid (JA) or cell-content feeding spider-mites. While candidate genes were strongly induced by JA, herbivory by spider mites resulted in downregulation. Malonyltransferase inducibility by JA was specific for a susceptible C. annuum accession. This project elucidated phylogeny and specificity of inducible defense compound decorations in Solanaceae, by combining phylogenetics, transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis.
