title: (29/09/22 - 30/09/22) 25th anniversary annual symposium of Max Plank Institute for Checmical Ecology
summary: I recently attended the annual symposium organized by Max Plank society for Checmical Ecology, Jena on their 25th anniversary. It was a great event and I had a chance to meet Sarah Oâ€™Connor (Department of Natural Product Biosynthesis), Jonathan Gershenzon (Department of Biochemistry), Jakob Franke (Hannover University), Sandra Irmisch (Leiden University, The Netherland), Eric Schranz (Wageningen University, The Netherlands) and Radhika Venkatesan (Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research, Kolkata, India). I also got a chance to catch up with some old friends. I would like to congratulate Max Plank on their 25th anniversary and also like to thank for organizing such a great event.
