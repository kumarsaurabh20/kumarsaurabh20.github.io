title: (28-05-25) Welcomed Prof. Dr. Ron Heeren from M4I Maastricht at the BFFI  
summary: An afternoon well spent with Prof. Dr. Ron M.A. Heeren at the Brightlands Future Farming Institute Brightlands Campus Greenport Venlo, Maastricht University. Ron is a pioneer in spatial molecular imaging M4i - Maastricht for Imaging, and his visit sparked engaging discussions around spatial transcriptomics and mass spec imaging and its integration with plant phenotyping. His insights into high-resolution molecular mapping opened up exciting possibilities for advancing our understanding of plant-environment interactions. We are especially inspired by the potential for collaboration, bringing together his expertise in imaging and our mission in plant systems biology and open data infrastructure. A big thank you (together with Wim Vriezen and Paolina Garbeva and all our colleagues at BFFI), Ron for sharing your vision and for an afternoon full of thought-provoking ideas. We are looking forward to exploring opportunities at the interface of molecular imaging and plant science.
