title: (28-05-25) Vittorio Nicoloso started in my group as a PhD student  
summary: Announcing a bit late but Vittorio Maria Nicoloso is a new PhD student, started in October 2024, promoted by Prof. Wim Vriezen and co-promoted by me within the group of Plant Functional Genomics. He has graduated within MSc degree on Plant Biotechnology at the university of Turin and for four years he worked between the Research Council of Italy and the University of Liege on different topic but all focused on Plant Bioinformatics. On this new career path, he will use his knowledge to study the structural variation in cucumber genomes. I welcome him in my group and wish him success with his work.
