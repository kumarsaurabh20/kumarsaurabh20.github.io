title: (12-04-25) Attended Experimental Plant Sciences (EPS) Annual meeting 2025 at the Egmond Aan Zea together with my group  
summary: Attended the experimental plant sciences (EPS) annual meeting 2025 in Egmond aan Zee. What an incredible gathering of researchers across diverse areas of plant science. Greatful to the EPS organising committee for putting together yet another successful and inspiring event. The meeting kicked off with an excellent welcome address by Saskia van Wees followed by insightful keynotes from Yoselin Benitez-Alfonso Mark Sterken Dmitry Lapin Emilyn Matsumura and Casper van der Kooi. Topics ranged from cell wall biophysics and plant-nematode interactions to salicylic acid signaling, plant viruses and the vibrant world of flower colouration. And the excitement does not stop here. We are looking forward to an engaging lineup of parallel sessions, flash talks and poster discussions continuing throughout today and tomorrow. A fantastic space for exchanging ideas and sparking new collaborations in plant research in the Netherlands.
