Thrilled to share that our 𝗧𝗲𝘅𝘁2𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝘁 project has been awarded an Advanced Research + Invention Agency (ARIA) pre-programme discovery grant! together with MD Sharma from the University of Exeter Centre for Ecology and Conservation, UK

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗲’𝗿𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴: A community-driven platform that turns plant-associated insects and microbiome literature into actionable knowledge graphs to accelerate genotype-to-phenotype discovery and multi-omics link prioritization. Under the hood is our human-in-the-loop engine, HARVEST, combining full-text mining, ontology-aware NLP, and expert curation to extract reliable gene–trait–metabolite–stress links with transparent evidence.
𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀: Plant functional genomics, breeding, crop and ecosystem resilience rely on knowledge that’s mostly hidden in scientific literature. Text2Trait will help researchers and breeders interpret GWAS hits, prioritize multi-omics links, and design decisive assays, faster and with provenance.
Huge thanks to collaborators Prof. Wim Vriezen @Brightlands Future Farming Institute (UM) and Dr. Aki Härmä @Department of Advanced Computing Sciences (UM), and to Advanced Research + Invention Agency (ARIA) for backing bold, translational science.
