<div style="text-align: justify">In this postdoctoral position, together with the WUR Bioinformatics group (Prof. Marnix Medema), Plant-Microbe interaction group (Prof. Saskia Van Wees/Prof. Corn√© Pieterse) at Utrecht University and Microbial Sciences group, Institute of Biology, Leiden University (Prof. Gilles van Wezel and Dr. Somayah Elsayed), I explore and implement innovative -omics integration strategies to map genes and their expression patterns to metabolites that play key roles in host-microbe interactions. We developed a method in this direction that integrates metabolomics and transcriptomics data and predicts putative reactions steps that could either be complete or partial steps of biosyntehtic pathways. This method represents a significant advancement towards obtaining a holistic view of plant metabolism and thus providing researchers, across disciplines, with a powerful tool to unravel complex metabolic routes and generate actionable hypotheses for further investigations.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">My postdoctoral work at the University of Exeter and Rothamsted Research are mainly driven by key questions in resistance evolution of insect-pests to  natural and synthetic insecticides.  I  used genome-wide investigations and computational approaches to  answer such questions, ensuring these are relevant to a broad scientific community. 

1. Our [work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217315427?via%3Dihub) on brownplanthoppers in elucidating the role of the cytochrome P450 CYP6ER1 in resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides provided a novel example of gene duplication and neofunctionalization leading to resistance development in this species. Brown planthopper is the most devastating pest of south-east Asia and the findings of this study have helped in building suitable IPM strategies. 
2. Transcriptional plasticity of phytophagous generalist pests has always puzzled researchers. To further explore this, I have assembled the [genome](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-6397-3) of a glasshouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum,  and helped perform  transcriptomics in  order  to  identify  differences  in expression of key genes on challenging host-plants. The findings in this work provide further insights in the ability of generalist pests to effectively reprogram genes expression during host-shift  and  the  potential  implication  of  transcriptional  plasticity  on  their  sensitivity  to synthetic insecticides. 
3. My primary research has exploited cutting edge bioinformatics approaches to consistently progress  beyond  the  state of the art.  I  have  developed  a novel  software  [pipeline](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8434319)  to electronically extend partial gene transcriptsup to full gene lengths, using raw RNA-seq data. This has helped characterize the correct number of genes, from different families, responsible for detoxifying allelochemicals in one of the solitary red mason bees.  
4. I also assembled the first [genome](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007903) sequence of a solitary bee Osmia  bicornis and  together  with  a PhD  student showed  that it  lacks  the  CYP9Q subfamily of CYP450s but, despite this, it exhibits low acute toxicity to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid. Functional studies revealed that a P450 within the CYP9BU subfamily, with recent shared ancestry to the Apidae CYP9Q subfamily, metabolises thiacloprid in vitro and confers tolerancein vivo. This [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982218302306?via%3Dihub) is the landmark discovery of inherent tolerance of thiacloprid in solitary bees and can be leveraged to avoid negative pesticide impacts on these important pollinators. 
5. My most impactful academic output has been the work on aphid, Myzus persicae, and its host-shift  to  tobacco. In  this  [work](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/19/eaba1070)  I  used  transcriptomics and genomics  approaches  to identify  molecular  signatures  and  genomic  rearrangements that  shape host  mediated resistance evolution in aphids. My contribution in this work has laid the foundation of further experimental work that has provided key insights into the evolutionary processes facilitating insect adaptation to a novel host plant. Importantly, all genomic resources, along with four insect genomes and software developed by me, are used by many groups, extending beyond my field of expertise, to explore new and exciting avenues in molecular and evolutionary biology.</div>
